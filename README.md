# golox
An implementation of jlox in Go from following along with the Crafting Interpreters book (https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

I'm new to Go and to writing interpreters. This is just for learning purposes.


# Building
Some of this code was autogenerated with the stringer tool, which I installed with:

```
go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer
```

Other than that, you should be able to run `go build`

# Running tests

```
go test .\...
```
