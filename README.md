# golox
An implementation of jlox in Go from following along with the Crafting Interpreters book (https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

This implementation is incomplete. It goes partway through Chapter 10 (Functions).

I'm new to Go and to writing interpreters. This is just for fun and for learning.


# Building
Some of this code was autogenerated with the stringer tool, which I installed with:

```
go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer
```

Other than that, you should be able to run `go build`

# Running tests

Windows:
```
go test .\...
```

Mac:
```
go test ./...
```
